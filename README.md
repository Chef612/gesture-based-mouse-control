# Gesture Based Mouse Control App
Task is to design a desktop application using Python which will be able to recognize gestures made by the user through his eyes/hands. Based on these gestures the user will be able to control mouse actions. More points will be awarded to the apps with better UI/UX.

**Skills Required:** Python, PyMouse, OpenCV
